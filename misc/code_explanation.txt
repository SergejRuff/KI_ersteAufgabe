kaggleÂ´s churn data is used for this homework.

The desicion tree requires numbers as input. Meaning values like male/female or yes/no
need to be translated into 1/2.
# replace Male/female with 0/1 for desicion tree
churn_df["gender"] = churn_df["gender"].replace(["Male","Female"],[0,1])

# replace yes/no with 0/1 for desicion tree
churn_df = churn_df.replace(["No","Yes"],[0,1])

tip: to generate a 2x2 matrix with the frequencies for 2 coloumns use crosstab-function.
# generate a 2x2 frequency table for
partner_churn_table = pd.crosstab(churn_df["Partner"],churn_df["Churn"])

plotting: a plot is only shown when you call it with plt.show() (need matplotlib).
even if its a panda plot. Otherwise everything is saved to memory but not shown.

Total Charges are not numeric and have a blank space in the values " ".
The blank space makes transforming the data values into float difficult.
So we have to remove the " " and replace them with nothing/NAn.
# Replace spaces with NaN in the "TotalCharges" column
churn_df["TotalCharges"] = churn_df["TotalCharges"].replace(' ', np.nan)
np.nan in this case introduces NAn.
we change datatype with .astype -> # attempt to convert the column to float
churn_df["TotalCharges"] = churn_df["TotalCharges"].astype(float)
and remove the nan introduced by np.nan

churn csv is suppose to be split into training and test data sets with 80/20 split
80 % training
20 % test
I use the following code:

# divide into training and test data: 80/20 %
churnx_train, churnx_test,churny_train, churny_test  = train_test_split(
    churn_df.drop("Churn",axis=1),churn_df["Churn"],test_size=0.2,random_state=0
)

churnx_train, churnx_test, churny_train, and churny_test are variables where the training and test data will be stored.
These variables are used to store the following data:

churnx_train: This represents the features/data (independent variables) of the training dataset.
churnx_test: These are the features/data of the test dataset.
churny_train: This typically represents the target variable/labels (the variable you're trying to predict) of the training dataset.
churny_test: This is the target variable/labels of the test dataset.

churn_df.drop("Churn", axis=1): This is the DataFrame containing the features (independent variables) of your dataset.
The drop method with axis=1 is used to remove the "Churn" column,"Churn" is the target variable that you want to predict,
and the rest of the columns are features.

churn_df["Churn"]: This is the Series or DataFrame containing the target variable you want to predict, in this case, "Churn."

test_size=0.2: This parameter specifies that you want to allocate 20% of the data to the test set,
and the remaining 80% will be used for training the machine learning model.

random_state=0: This is used to seed the random number generator, ensuring that the split is reproducible.
Setting it to a specific number, like 0, ensures that every time you run this code, you'll get the same split if the dataset and parameters remain the same.
set.seed() in R.
