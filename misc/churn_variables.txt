this file explains how the independent variables
correlate to churn.

My findings:

Those who have partners and dependents (family members) are less likely to churn.
Meaning we should use those two variables for our decision tree.
Tenure: people who stick longer to a  company are less likely to
leave said company - longer tenure number = less churn.

plot for gender vs churn shows what there is no meaningful diffrence between
genders.
Seniors have a higher percentage of churning in comparison to non-seniors.
Those with higher MonthlyCharges tend to churn more.
Higher monthy charge = more likely to churn.

used variables:

Dependents
Partner
SeniorCitizen

those two are useful but are removed because they have
too many unique values.
Idea: you could group the data into bins and run the tree.
Otherwise too many unique values are not meant for a decision tree.
MonthlyCharges
TotalCharges
tenure
> pd.cut() can turn continues values into bins/classes. - need to provide bins.

useless info
gender.
