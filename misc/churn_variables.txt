this file explains how the independent variables
correlate to churn.

My findings:

Those who have partners and dependents (family members) are less likely to churn.
Meaning we should use those two variables for our decision tree.
Tenure: people who stick longer to a  company are less likely to
leave said company - longer tenure number = less churn.

plot for gender vs churn shows what there is no meaningful diffrence between
genders.
Seniors have a higher percentage of churning in comparison to non-seniors.
Those with higher MonthlyCharges tend to churn more.
